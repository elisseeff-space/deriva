"""
TechnologyService Derivation.

A TechnologyService represents an externally visible unit of functionality,
offered by a technology node (e.g., database, message queue, external API).

Graph signals:
- External dependency nodes (imported packages/libraries)
- Nodes with labels like ExternalDependency, Database, API
- High out-degree from application code (many things depend on it)
- Configuration files referencing external services

Filtering strategy:
- Start with ExternalDependency and similar labeled nodes
- Filter to high-importance dependencies (PageRank)
- Exclude standard library and utility packages
- Focus on infrastructure services (databases, queues, APIs)

LLM role:
- Classify which dependencies are technology services vs utilities
- Generate meaningful service names
- Write documentation describing the service's role

Relationships:
- OUTBOUND: TechnologyService -> DataObject (Access) - access databases/files
- OUTBOUND: TechnologyService -> ApplicationService (Serving) - serve app services
- INBOUND: DataObject -> TechnologyService (Realization) - config realizes tech

ArchiMate Layer: Technology Layer
ArchiMate Type: TechnologyService

Typical Sources:
    - ExternalDependency nodes (databases, message queues, APIs)
    - Technology nodes from LLM extraction
