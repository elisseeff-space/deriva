"""
BusinessProcess Derivation.

A BusinessProcess represents a sequence of business behaviors that achieves
a specific outcome such as a defined set of products or business services.

Graph signals:
- Method nodes (functions implementing business logic)
- Nodes with workflow/process naming patterns
- High betweenness centrality (orchestrates other components)
- Route handlers in web applications
- Orchestrator methods (call 3+ other methods)

Filtering strategy:
1. Query Method nodes from source code
2. Exclude utility/helper methods
3. Prioritize methods with business-relevant names
4. Focus on methods that coordinate activities
5. Identify orchestrator methods via CALLS edge count

LLM role:
- Identify which methods represent business processes
- Generate meaningful process names
- Write documentation describing the process purpose

Relationships:
- OUTBOUND: BusinessProcess -> BusinessObject (Access) - processes access business objects
- INBOUND: None defined

ArchiMate Layer: Business Layer
ArchiMate Type: BusinessProcess

Typical Sources:
    - Method nodes with workflow/orchestration logic
    - Functions with names like process_*, handle_*, execute_*
    - Orchestrator methods that coordinate multiple sub-operations
