"""
SystemSoftware Derivation.

A SystemSoftware represents software that provides or contributes to an
environment for storing, executing, and using software or data deployed
within it.

Graph signals:
- Operating system references
- Runtime/platform dependencies
- Container base images
- Middleware and platform services

Filtering strategy:
1. Query ExternalDependency and File nodes
2. Filter for system/platform patterns
3. Exclude application-level libraries
4. Focus on infrastructure software

LLM role:
- Identify which dependencies are system software
- Generate meaningful software names
- Write documentation describing the software's role

ArchiMate Layer: Technology Layer
ArchiMate Type: SystemSoftware

Typical Sources:
    - Runtime/platform dependencies (Python, Node.js, JVM)
    - Container base images (alpine, debian, ubuntu)
