"""
BusinessFunction Derivation.

A BusinessFunction represents a collection of business behavior based on a
chosen set of criteria (typically required business resources and/or competencies),
closely aligned to an organization, but not necessarily explicitly governed by
the organization.

Graph signals:
- Module/package structures representing business capabilities
- Groups of related methods/classes
- Service layers and domain modules
- High-level organizational code structures

Filtering strategy:
1. Query Module and Package nodes
2. Filter for business-relevant modules
3. Exclude utility/infrastructure modules
4. Focus on domain-specific capabilities

LLM role:
- Identify which modules represent business functions
- Generate meaningful function names
- Write documentation describing the business capability

ArchiMate Layer: Business Layer
ArchiMate Type: BusinessFunction

Typical Sources:
    - Module/package nodes representing business domains
    - High-level directory structures (e.g., orders/, invoices/)
