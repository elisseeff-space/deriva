"""
ApplicationInterface Derivation.

An ApplicationInterface represents a point of access where application services
are made available to a user, another application component, or a node.

Graph signals:
- API endpoint definitions (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Public methods/functions exposed to external callers
- Route handlers in web frameworks
- Interface/protocol definitions

Filtering strategy:
1. Query Method nodes that represent endpoints/handlers
2. Filter for API/interface patterns
3. Exclude internal/private methods
4. Focus on externally accessible entry points

LLM role:
- Identify which methods represent interfaces
- Generate meaningful interface names
- Write documentation describing the interface purpose

ArchiMate Layer: Application Layer
ArchiMate Type: ApplicationInterface

Typical Sources:
    - API endpoint definitions (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
    - Public interface/protocol method definitions
