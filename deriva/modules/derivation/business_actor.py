"""
BusinessActor Derivation.

A BusinessActor represents a business entity that is capable of performing
behavior. This includes users, roles, departments, or external parties.

Graph signals:
- TypeDefinition nodes with user/role/actor patterns
- BusinessConcept nodes representing people or organizations
- Authentication/authorization related code
- Route handlers with user context
- Auth-decorated methods (permission checks, role requirements)

Filtering strategy:
1. Query TypeDefinition and BusinessConcept nodes
2. Detect auth-related decorators (@login_required, @permission, @role, etc.)
3. Filter for actor/role/user patterns
4. Exclude technical/utility classes
5. Focus on entities that perform actions

LLM role:
- Identify which types represent actors
- Generate meaningful actor names
- Write documentation describing the actor's role

ArchiMate Layer: Business Layer
ArchiMate Type: BusinessActor

Typical Sources:
    - TypeDefinition nodes (User, Role, Admin, Customer classes)
    - BusinessConcept nodes representing organizational roles
    - Methods with auth/permission decorators (indicate actor context)
