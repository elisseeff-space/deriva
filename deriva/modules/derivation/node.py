"""
Node Derivation.

A Node represents a computational or physical resource that hosts, manipulates,
or interacts with other computational or physical resources.

Graph signals:
- Server/container definitions
- Kubernetes deployments and services
- Cloud resource definitions (EC2, VMs)
- Docker Compose service definitions

Filtering strategy:
1. Query File nodes with deployment/infrastructure patterns
2. Filter for node/server patterns
3. Exclude application-level definitions
4. Focus on infrastructure nodes

LLM role:
- Identify which configs represent nodes
- Generate meaningful node names
- Write documentation describing the node's role

ArchiMate Layer: Technology Layer
ArchiMate Type: Node

Typical Sources:
    - Kubernetes deployment/service definitions
    - Docker Compose service configurations
    - Infrastructure-as-code server definitions
