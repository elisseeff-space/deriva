"""
BusinessEvent Derivation.

A BusinessEvent represents an organizational state change. Events may originate
from the environment (e.g., customers), or be triggered by services, processes,
or other events.

Graph signals:
- Event handler methods (on*, handle*, emit*, trigger*)
- Message/event classes and types
- Callback functions
- Signal definitions
- Webhook handlers (decorator detection)
- Message queue consumers

Filtering strategy:
1. Query Method and TypeDefinition nodes
2. Detect event-related decorators (webhook, event, signal, celery, etc.)
3. Filter for event/handler patterns
4. Exclude utility event handlers
5. Focus on business-relevant events

LLM role:
- Identify which handlers represent business events
- Generate meaningful event names
- Write documentation describing the event trigger and impact

ArchiMate Layer: Business Layer
ArchiMate Type: BusinessEvent

Typical Sources:
    - Method nodes with event handler patterns (on_*, handle_*)
    - Event class definitions and signal handlers
    - Webhook endpoints and message queue consumers
