"""
DataObject Derivation.

A DataObject represents data structured for automated processing.
This includes database tables, files, messages, and other data structures.

Graph signals:
- File nodes (especially data files, configs, schemas)
- TypeDefinition nodes representing data structures
- Nodes related to persistence, storage, or data transfer

Filtering strategy:
1. Query File nodes with data-related types
2. Include schema/config/data files
3. Exclude source code and templates
4. Focus on structured data artifacts

LLM role:
- Identify which files/types represent data objects
- Generate meaningful data object names
- Write documentation describing the data purpose

Relationships:
- OUTBOUND: DataObject -> TechnologyService (Realization) - config realizes tech
- INBOUND: TechnologyService -> DataObject (Access) - tech accesses data
- INBOUND: ApplicationService -> DataObject (Flow) - app services flow data
- INBOUND: BusinessProcess -> DataObject (Access) - processes access data

ArchiMate Layer: Application Layer
ArchiMate Type: DataObject

Typical Sources:
    - File nodes with .json, .yaml, .xml, .csv extensions
    - Schema definition files and configuration files
