"""
ApplicationService Derivation.

An ApplicationService represents an explicitly defined exposed application
behavior. This includes API endpoints, web routes, and service interfaces.

Graph signals:
- Method nodes with route/endpoint patterns
- Functions decorated with @app.route, @api.get, etc.
- Controller/handler methods
- Methods in files named routes.py, api.py, views.py

Filtering strategy:
1. Query Method nodes
2. Filter for route/endpoint patterns
3. Look for HTTP method indicators (get, post, put, delete)
4. Focus on externally exposed interfaces

LLM role:
- Identify which methods are application services
- Generate meaningful service names
- Write documentation describing the service's purpose

Relationships:
- OUTBOUND: ApplicationService -> BusinessObject (Flow) - services transfer data
- INBOUND: TechnologyService -> ApplicationService (Serving) - tech serves app services

ArchiMate Layer: Application Layer
ArchiMate Type: ApplicationService

Typical Sources:
    - Method nodes with @route, @api decorators
    - Methods in routes.py, api.py, views.py, controllers.py
