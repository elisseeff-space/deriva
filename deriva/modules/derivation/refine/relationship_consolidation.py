"""
Relationship Consolidation - Refine Step.

Consolidates and improves relationship quality by:
1. Boosting confidence when multiple derivation signals agree
2. Pruning low-confidence relationships with no corroboration
3. Merging equivalent relationships from different derivation sources

This step runs after initial derivation to improve model quality.

Confidence boosting rules:
- Same source/target with multiple relationship types: +0.05 per additional signal
- Edge-based + community-based derivation agree: +0.10
- Edge-based + name-based derivation agree: +0.10
- All three signals agree: +0.15 (total)

Pruning rules:
- Confidence < min_confidence (default 0.5): pruned
- Single-signal derivation with confidence < require_corroboration_threshold: pruned
