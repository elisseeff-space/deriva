Circular Relationships Detection - Refine Step.

Detects and breaks circular Composition relationships in the ArchiMate model:
- Bidirectional pairs: A→B AND B→A (both Composition)
- Longer cycles: A→B→C→A (all Composition)

Circular containment is invalid in ArchiMate - a component cannot both
contain and be contained by another component.
